## Overview
This project implements a binary classification model using XGBoost to predict whether the outcome will be 'A' or 'B' based on various features. The model uses feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and proper validation techniques to ensure good performance.

## Files
- `Classify.py`: Main Python script containing the classification model implementation
- `Classify.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook version of the classification model
- `train.csv`: Training dataset with labeled examples
- `test.csv`: Test dataset for making predictions
- `sample_submission.csv`: Example submission format
- `classification_submission.csv`: Generated predictions file

## Features
- Feature engineering (score differences, health differences, armor differences)
- Categorical variable encoding
- Missing value imputation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation using F1-score
- Submission file generation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- seaborn (for visualization)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/classification-project.git
cd classification-project
```

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the classification model:
```bash
python Classify.py
```

This will:
1. Load and preprocess the training data
2. Engineer new features
3. Train an XGBoost model with optimized hyperparameters
4. Make predictions on the test set
5. Generate a submission file

## Model Details
The model uses XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning for:
- Number of estimators
- Maximum depth
- Learning rate
- Subsample ratio
- Column sample ratio

The best parameters are selected using 3-fold cross-validation with F1-score as the evaluation metric.

## Data Processing
- Categorical features are encoded using LabelEncoder
- Missing values are imputed using mean strategy
- Feature engineering creates difference metrics between teams A and B

## Output
The script generates a CSV file with predictions that can be used for submission.
